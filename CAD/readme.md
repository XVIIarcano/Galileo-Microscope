# Printing Instructions for the Crayford Focuser

This folder collects useful files for the Galileo design which are not stricly part of the main source files in the CAD folder, but are still useful to have for referencing, easier generation of derivatives or variants etc...

A special thanks goes to @roovian on discord for coding the OpenSCAD file that generates standoffs with serial numbers on them.
Use of that file is subject to the rules of the game as per the serial related channels on discord, if ou just grab it and print it, that's called cheating :P
