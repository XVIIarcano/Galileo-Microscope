# CAD files and resources

This folder collects useful files for the Galileo design, including the main source files for the "vanilla"  version of Galileo and a couple more, to make it easier to reference dimensions, generate derivatives, and multiple variants of certian components...

A special thanks goes to @roovian on discord for coding the [OpenSCAD file that generates standoffs with serial numbers on them](https://github.com/XVIIarcano/Galileo-Microscope/blob/main/CAD/Serial%20standoff%20generator.scad).
Use of that file is subject to the rules of the game as per the serial related channels on discord, if ou just grab it and print it, that's called cheating :P
