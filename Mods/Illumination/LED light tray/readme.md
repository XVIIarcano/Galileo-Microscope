#Description

Designed this LED light to slide into the phone illumination module for the GALILEO Modular Microscope.  All of the parts were printed in Hatchbox PLA with the exception of the strain relief grommet which is PETG.  Note that the grommet will not fit unless it is printed at 69% in the X,Y directions and 100% Z direction.  I tried to make the changes in the grommet CAD file but it blows up when reduced that far.

The slide switch is wired to change between the TOP light and the BOTTOM light.  The LEDs in the parts list include a cable for USB charger and can be dimmed by holding the on/off button. 

When tightening the screws for the TOP arm tighten just enough to prevent unwanted movement so it can be repositioned easily.

I think the rest can be seen in the photos.
