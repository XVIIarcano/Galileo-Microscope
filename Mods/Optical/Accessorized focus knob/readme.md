This modified knob and split ring allow the following:

- securing the knob with M3x6 screws instead of the glue 

- Attaching a lever to the knob for finer focus

- Attaching a gear ring, with a matching knob on any protruding vertical post for an even finer control

## Bill of Materials

- One set of printed parts, printed using the same settings as the rest of the microscope.

- 3x M3x6 SCHS screws for securing the knob to the split ring.
- 3x M3 nuts 
- 1x M3x30 SCHS screw for the lever.
- 3x M3x16 SHCS nuts for the gear ring.

## Assembling

- Thread the three M3x6 screws in the bottom holes around the perimeter of the knob, be gentle since you are threading on plastic. Do not tighten them all in yet.

- Drop M3 nuts in all three slots.

- Place the split ring in its seat on the spider, following the normal instructions for the anti backlash springs too.

- Position the nut and align the notches in the split ring with the screws.
Tighten the screws making sure they lock on the pockets on the split ring.
 
- Add the lever or the gear ring. 

>[!TIP]
>The rationale for the three nuts, even if you use only one lever, is that you may want to change the lever position based on where the focus point tends to fall for you, and taking the nuts out is not practical.
