To fit to the Microscope use the stock hardware of 3 x M5x12 SHCS and 3 x M5 Hex Nuts however a modification to a tool is needed, cut down the short end of an allen key where it fits into the head of the screw right at where the short end bends to the long end. The focuser body can be lifted to be level with the top of the stock length aluminium tubes to help with access to the samples and wont effect the function of the focuser, To which longer tube covers could be used to cover the exposed aluminium tube if desiered.
