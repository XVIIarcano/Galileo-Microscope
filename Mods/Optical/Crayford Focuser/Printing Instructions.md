Printing Instructions for the Crayford Focuser

Items marked with [a] are designated as accent, all others are primary colour.

All items have version that dont require any user added support, however there are some that ether have inbuilt removable supports or will need default slicer support adding which are only there for aesthetic reasons. Make sure that you print the corresponding parts (they are labelled in the naming structure) for example the Focuser_Body_x1 (Built in removable support).stl has a section that needs to be removed after printing where the Bearing_Block_x1 (Built in removable Support Version).stl is fitted, it should be easily removable and leave minimal signs it was there if printer/material used allows, and can be disposed of.
