# Printing Instructions for the Crayford Focuser

Items marked with [a] are designated as accent, all others are primary colour.

** Print your chosen version parts I.E support vs non-support as there is a difference. **

All items have version that dont require any user added support, however there are some that ether have inbuilt removable supports or will need default slicer support adding which are only there for aesthetic reasons. Make sure that you print the corresponding parts (they are labelled in the naming structure) for example the Focuser_Body_x1 (Built in removable support).stl has a section that needs to be removed after printing where the Bearing_Block_x1 (Built in removable Support Version).stl is fitted, it should be easily removable and leave minimal signs it was there if printer/material used allows, and can be disposed of.

# Assembling

Body Assembly

Install the heat set inserts into the Focuser_Body_x1.stl (x4), then.

Put the 4x 'U' Groove bearings into the slots on the inside of the tube race in the Focuser_Body_x1.stl securing with the 4x M4x20 SHCS.

Focus Knob Assembly

Grind at least a 12mm flat side to the 110.5mm 5mm Diameter Rod on each end, then.

Fit one [a]_Focus_Knob_x2.stl to the 110.5mm 5mm Diameter Rod end using 1x M3x6 SHCS and slide on the 2x 16mm O/D 5mm I/D x 5mm Wide 625ZZ Bearings then fix the other [a]_Focus_Knob_x2.stl to the other end using the other M3x6 SHCS, then.

Fit the 2x 16mm O/D 5mm I/D x 5mm Wide 625ZZ Bearings with 110.5mm 5mm Diameter Rod and [a]_Focus_Knob_x2.stl into the Bearing_Block_x1.stl slots, then.

Align to the corresponding slots on the Focuser_Body_x1.stl (if using the No Support versions take not of the orientation by the direction arrow on the inside of the Bearing_Block_x1.stl) and using 4x M3x8 SHCS fix both assemblies together.

Tube Assembly

Glue (use CA glue i.e super glue) the 113mm x 10mm x 1mm Rubber Sheet to the 'flat' on the Tube_x1.stl and wait to dry, then.

Using an end of the 109mm x 2mm Diameter Rod shave off any plastic from the grooves in the Tube_x1.stl until the rods sit in the tube where the tube can smoothly without binding or any slop into the Focuser_Body_x1.stl making sure the 109mm x 2mm Diameter Rod sits in the groove of the 'U' Groove bearings, then.

Once fitting smoothly and correctly glue the rods onto the Tube_X1.stl (use CA glue i.e super glue) and wait till dry, then.

slide the Tube_x1.stl into the Focuser_Body_x1.stl

Tube to Thread Adaptor

Install the 3 x heat set inserts into the Tube_to_thread_adaptor_x1.stl, then.

Using 3 x M3x8 SHCS fix the Tube_to_thread_adaptor_x1.stl into the bottom of the Tube_x1.stl NOTE: this will lock the Tube_x1.stl into the Focuser_Body_x1.stl the screws will fit into the 3 slots on the bottom of the Focuser_Body_x1.stl when at full focus hight.

Eyepiece

Fit the stock spec eyepiece into the Eyepiece_Adaptor_x1.stl and place in the top of the Tube_x1.stl and then screw down the [a]_Eyepiece_Locker_x1.stl.

Crayford Focuser Complete

To fit to the Microscope use the stock hardware of 3 x M5x12 SHCS and 3 x M5 Hex Nuts however a modification to a tool is needed, cut down the short end of an Allen key where it fits into the head of the screw right at where the short end bends to the long end. The focuser body can be lifted to be level with the top of the stock length aluminium tubes to help with access to the samples and wont effect the function of the focuser, To which longer tube covers could be used to cover the exposed aluminium tube if desired. Also if desired there are [a]_Aluminium_Tube_Top_Caps_x3.stl's which are again purly cosmetic they have a 10.3mm O/D designed to fit 12mm O/D 11mm I/D aluminium tubes (they are a drop in fit) however if your tubes have a smalled I/D these will need sanding to fit.
